## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will understand:
- ✅ What ACID really means in distributed contexts
- ✅ The CAP theorem and why it matters
- ✅ Different consistency models and when to use them
- ✅ Isolation levels and their trade-offs

---

## 🔥 Why This Matters

The CAP theorem is one of the **most asked topics** in system design interviews. Understanding it deeply helps you:
- Make informed database choices
- Design for your specific requirements
- Explain trade-offs clearly
